# Disaster-Recovery

This diagram appears to be a representation of a multi-tier architecture for a web application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's a detailed explanation of the various components in the diagram:

*Amazon EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud, which provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.


*ORACLE: A popular relational database management system.


*AWS WAF: Web Application Firewall, which helps protect web applications from common web exploits.


*Mobile Client: A client application running on a mobile device.


*Region 1 and Region 2: AWS provides multiple regions around the world to enable users to deploy their applications closer to their end-users.


*Availability Zone: Each region is divided into multiple availability zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance.


*Public Subnet (jump tire), Public Subnet (LB tire), Public Subnet (Web Tire), Public Subnet (Jump Tire), and Public Subnet (LB tire): These are subnets within a VPC (Virtual *Private Cloud) that are connected to the internet through an Internet Gateway.


*Bastion Host (3): A bastion host, also known as a jump box, is a hardened server used to manage other servers in a private network.


*VPC NAT Gateway: A NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway is used to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet.


*Amazon Cloudhsm: A cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables users to generate and store cryptographic keys.


*Amazon Route S3 (DNS): A service that enables users to route traffic to their Amazon S3 bucket by using a custom domain name.


*IAM: Identity and Access Management, which enables users to control access to AWS services and resources.


*Digital Web, Digital Web, Digital Web, Digital DB, Core DB, and Core DB: These are AWS resources that are part of the application stack.
*EC2: These are compute instances running within the VPC.


*Role: An IAM role that enables the EC2 instances to access other AWS services.


*Amazon S3: A highly durable and scalable object storage service.


*Amazon EFS: Elastic File System, which provides a shared file system for use with Amazon EC2 instances.


*HTTP/TLS Traffic: The traffic flowing through the network using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.


*AWS Shield: A managed DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service.


*Amazon EBS: Elastic Block Store, which provides persistent block-level storage for Amazon EC2 instances.


*VPC Peering: A connection between two VPCs that enables resources in the two VPCs to communicate with each other.


*Amazon Route S3 (DNS): A service that enables users to route traffic to their Amazon S3 bucket by using a custom domain name.


*Amazon Simple Notification System: A fully managed messaging service that enables users to send and receive messages.


*AWS WAF Event (Time-Based): A feature of AWS WAF that enables users to define time-based rules for web traffic.


*AWS Cloud Infrastructure: The underlying infrastructure that powers AWS.


*Amazon Cloudwatch: A monitoring and observability service that provides real-time visibility into AWS resources and applications.


*Alarm: An alert that is triggered when a metric exceeds a threshold.



In summary, this diagram represents a complex multi-tier architecture for a web application hosted on AWS, with various AWS services and resources distributed across multiple regions and availability zones. The architecture includes a public-facing web tier, an application tier, and a database tier, along with various security and monitoring features.
